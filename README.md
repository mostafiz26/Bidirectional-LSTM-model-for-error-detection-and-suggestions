# Bidirectional-LSTM-model-for-error-detection-and-suggestions

We have used the Chainer framework and python 2 for this project. User should define the number of epoch (n_epoch = 30) in trainer.py code. The basic command for model training and error detection is given bellow. 

For model Training

python trainer.py 200(layers)

For error Detection

python detector.py 200(layers) 20(epoch) test.c (erroneosu code)
